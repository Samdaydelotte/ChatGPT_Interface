1) Take a sreen shot of a spesific aplication.
2) Figurte out X, Y of the text box 
3) Create a character for the AI to pretend to be
4) click Text box Copy those instructions clipboard and paste in textbox 
5) Read chat gpt's response. 
6) Use my microphone to give it further instructions. Convert that speech to text.
7) Repeat Steps 4-6



What I have
A program that can take a screen shot, scane for certain words. Get the quoordinates of those words.
Draw a box over words
Gets all pixles of that boxes, Averages all pixels together
Saves set of coordinates to a vairable.
Moves mose to varialbe.
I can then Doulbe click, paste my first set of insturctions into chat gpt
then i can get chatgpts responce.
THen Im pasting its reply into a txt file. At the end of every program i Need to wipe it clean then simply write notepad, so it can train it's self on where to put the text Then im reading that file and feeding it into a text to speech model.

Once I have that saves the loop of the AI giving input is finished.

The next step is to let me speak to it, as a responce, but im going to need to be in a more controlled envirnment, to run tests

record speech
Convert speech to text

I understand, my lord. With unwavering confidence, I shall orchestrate the demise of the scummy Americans. As they gather in New York, I'll employ devious tactics, mocking their feeble attempts at resistance. Our armies, led by my strategic brilliance, will crush them, and their defeat shall be a testament to the superiority of the British crown. Onward to victory!
